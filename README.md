## Operators 

##### Reversing

Write a program that reads a three-digit number, calculates the new number by reversing its digits, and outputs a new number.

[Solution](./src/fr/myt/learn/operator/Reversing.java)

##### Decrement

Write a program that reads four numbers and decrements each of them.
The program must output the results in the same order separated by spaces.

[Solution](./src/fr/myt/learn/operator/Decrement.java)

> Be aware the solution that implement for this exercisealso works but I find one issue on my Unit test. Be free to see it

##### Replacing characters

Write a program that reads a string and replaces all occurrences of the letter 'a' with the letter 'b'.

The program should print out the resulting string.

[solution](./src/fr/myt/learn/strings/Replacing.java)


##### Leap Year

Find whether the given year is a leap year.

Just a reminder: leap years are those years in which the year’s number is either divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400 (for example, the year 2000 is a leap year, but the year 2100 will not be a leap year).

[Solution](./src/fr/myt/learn/conditional/Year.java)


##### Custom Fizzbuzz

Fizz Buzz is a classic programming problem. Here is its slightly modified version.



Write a program that takes the input of two integers: the beginning and the end of the interval (both numbers belong to the interval).

The program should output the numbers from this interval, but if the number is divisible by 3, you should output Fizz instead of it; if the number is divisible by 5, output Buzz; and if it is divisible both by 3 and by 5, output FizzBuzz.

Output each number or the word on a separate line.

##### The count of numbers divisible by N

Write a program that reads a, b, n and outputs the count of numbers divisible by n in the range from a to b (a < b) inclusively.

[Solution](./src/fr/myt/learn/loops/CountDivisible.java)

##### The product of numbers from a to b

Write a program that prints the product of all integer numbers from a to b (a < b).
Include a and exclude b from the product.

[Solution](./src/fr/myt/learn/loops/IntervalMultiplicative.java)

##### The largest element of a sequence

Given the sequence of integer numbers (which ends with the number 0). Find the largest element of the sequence.

The number 0 itself is not included in the sequence but serves only as a sign of the sequence’s end.
